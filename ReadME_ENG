# Project: Traffic Sign Recognition (GTSRB)
======================================

This repository contains all the necessary components to build a traffic sign recognition model for **Project 2 – Autonomous Driving**, based on the **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)** dataset.

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch** is implemented, covering the full pipeline including **data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference**.

## Project Structure and File Roles
==================================

The main pipeline scripts are presented first, followed by analysis tools, outputs, and exploration notebooks.

---

### Main Scripts (Model Pipeline)
================================

- **model.py**  
  Defines the CNN architecture for the 43 traffic sign classes.

- **data.py**  
  Loads the GTSRB dataset and performs preprocessing (resizing, normalization, label encoding) with a focus on reproducibility.

- **train.py**  
  Trains the model using dropout and Early Stopping, and saves the trained weights.

- **evaluate.py**  
  Evaluates the model on validation/test data using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

- **infer_demo.py**  
  Performs inference on unseen images to demonstrate the model’s generalization capability.

---

### Analysis and Visualization Scripts
=====================================

- **inspect_errors.py**  
  Analyzes misclassifications and confusions between visually similar traffic signs.

- **plot_training_curves.py**  
  Generates loss and accuracy curves to assess convergence and detect overfitting.

---

### Results and Output Files
============================

- **training_history.json**  
  Training history used for performance analysis and visualization.

- **classification_report.txt**  
  Detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **baseline_cnn.keras**  
  Final trained CNN model.

---

### Exploration Notebook
========================

- **01_explore_dataset.ipynb**  
  Initial exploratory analysis of the GTSRB dataset.
